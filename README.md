# FuncPort 🐍

**FuncPort** is a lightweight, pure Python utility library providing a collection of clean and practical helper functions for everyday programming tasks.

We started with string and list utilities, but the goal is to gradually expand with useful functions across various domains, such as:
- Number handling and data conversion
- Validation and type checking
- Date and time operations
- File and path utilities
- And anything else developers frequently need in daily work

**Simple, fully tested, no external dependencies, and always growing!**

## Features
- Clean and readable code
- Comprehensive tests with pytest
- Zero external dependencies (pure Python)
- Clear documentation
- Designed for ease of use and future extensibility
